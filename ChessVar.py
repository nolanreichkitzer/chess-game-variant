#              This module contains the ChessVar class that allows the user to play a chess game. There are
#              additional classes used to generate the different chess pieces. The rules of this game are different
#              from the normal rules. In this version, the winner is the first player to capture all of an opponent's
#              pieces of one type. Also, castling, en passant, and pawn promotion are not allowed.

    A class used to represent a Chess game. The game is a variant of Chess with different rules.

    The starting position for the game is the normal starting position for standard chess. This class keeps track of
    the player's turn with white having the first turn. The winner is the first player to capture all of an opponent's
    pieces of one type. The king isn't a special piece in this game, and there is no check or checkmate. Pieces move
    and capture the same as in normal chess, except that there is no castling, en passant, or pawn promotion.

    Locations on the board are specified using "algebraic notation", with columns labeled a-h and rows labeled 1-8.


    Attributes
    ----------

        A dictionary representing the chessboard grid. Keys are the chessboard grid squares, values are ChessPiece
        objects occupying the squares. Dictionary is initialized to the starting state of a normal chess game using the
        set_board method and will be populated by ChessPiece objects.
    piece_inventory : dictionary
        A dictionary representing the piece inventory with piece names as keys and piece counts as values.
        Dictionary is initialized to empty dictionary and filled after the chessboard is set using the
        update_piece_inventory method. This dictionary keeps track of white and black pieces separately.
    player_turn : string
        Represents who has the current turn. Data member will either be 'WHITE' or 'BLACK' and is initialized to 'WHITE'
    game_state : string
        Represents the status of the game. Data member is initialized to 'UNFINISHED' and will be set to 'WHITE_WON'
        if white makes a winning move or 'BLACK_WON' if black makes a winning move
